<h1>The Best Movies According to Shashank</h1>
<h2>My top 7 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Gods must be Crazy</h3>
<p>A duology, i.e. a collection of 2 movies. Also, two of the most beautiful movies I have ever watched. Takes you completely away from the hustle of the modern life, into the existential reality of life, through the eyes of the Kalahari bushmen.</p>

<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>I am not a big fan of romantic movies. However, this is one my all-time favorites. Truly Spectacular Cinema!!</p>

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>A True Masterpiece of Cinema that has really stood the test of time.</p>

<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>One of the greatest Sci-Fi movies ever made. The Gold Standard of Science Fiction.</p>

<h3>The Terminator</h3>
<p>A sci-fi classic that never fails to TERRIFY and also entertain!</p>

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Incredibly complex, challenging to watch, but great fun when you understand what the hell is going on. A visionary piece of art (could've been a little more visionary, but no complaints :D )</p>

<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>Probably one of the most visually stunning movies ever made, aside from the Marvel stuff, of course.</p>
